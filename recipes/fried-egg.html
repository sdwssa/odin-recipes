        <h2>Description</h2>
        A fried egg is a cooked dish made from one or more eggs which are removed from their shells and placed into a frying pan and fried. They are traditionally eaten for breakfast in many countries but may also be served at other times of the day.
        <h2>Things you'll need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Frying Pan</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the pan</li>
            Start by putting your pan on the burner on high heat. Let it sit for a minute or two until the pan comes up to temperature. You can test this by getting your fingers wet and flicking some water onto the pan. If the skillet is hot enough, the droplets should boil away almost instantly. When that happens, you’re ready to start cooking.
            <li>Add Oil</li>
            Even with a non-stick pan, you’re going to want to add some oil. This is essential for creating the crispy edges you want on a good fried egg. That said, you don’t want your egg to be drowning in oil. A single tablespoon of light vegetable oil will do the trick. At this point, reduce the heat to medium-low.
            <li>Add your egg.. slowly</li>
            One of the toughest things about making fried eggs is getting a clean, round shape, instead of splattering egg white all over the pan. To do this, crack your egg into a small bowl or a deep saucer. Then, gently transfer it from the bowl to the pan. This will keep it as close to round as possible, so it will cook more evenly.
            <li>Add water and cover</li>
            Let your egg cook until it’s turned white around the edges. At that point, add a tablespoon of water to the pan, and cover it as securely as possible to trap any steam. Leave the egg covered until the white is completely solid.
            <li>Remove and serve</li>
            While the yolk is still runny, remove the egg from the pan. Now comes the fun part: serving it up. All by itself, a fried egg makes a good addition to many ramen recipes. You can make your egg on one burner while you prepare your noodles on the other. It won’t take any extra time, and you’ve given your ramen a big boost of flavor, texture, and nutrients.
